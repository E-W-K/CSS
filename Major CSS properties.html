        <p>Honestly, my inspiration came from within me. My passion and love for technology has always been something I
            have overlooked and now,
            I think is the chance to do something which not only I, but future generations will appreciate. I chose this
            topic because it interests me. As someone
            who really likes spending most of his time on the computer, I felt I should choose a topic that makes me
            spending time on the computer worthwhile.

        <h2>My Lesson so far and how css is important</h2>
        <p>
            Since I started the programme, I have learnt about HTML and CSS in the Software developemnt cohort. HTML
            provides a structure of the page while CSS is used for adding style to the page. CSS is responsible for the
            colorful and stylish webpages that you see on the internet.
            In web development, CSS is very important because it helps to create a good impression towards thos
            einteracting with the web page. The interactivity is better when CSS is deployed
            in webpages like in ecommerce websites. The users are able to interact with the elemnts of the webpage more
            easily.The fonts,size and color contribute to the style of the page.

        <h2>Difference between paddings, margins and borders</h2>
        <p>
            Padding is the  space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders.
            Margin can be defined by left, right, top, bottom.
            <br>
            Margin is  space around elements, outside of any defined borders.
            <br>
            Border is is a shorthand syntax in CSS that accepts multiple values for drawing a line around the element it is applied to.
